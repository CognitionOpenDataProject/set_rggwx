For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 3.1. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 3.1. Effects of visibility
> We compared co-actors’ normalized performance between the ‘hidden’ and ‘visible’ conditions (Fig. 2; for the non-normalized data see Table 1). In line with our hypothesis that co-actors would try to reduce the temporal variability of their actions when they could not see each other, performance was not only faster (smaller normalized TTmean), t(15) = −3.29, p < 0.01, Cohen’s d = −0.82, but also less variable (smaller normalized TTvariability), t(15) = −2.52, p < 0.05, Cohen’s d = −0.63, in the ‘hidden’ condition. In line with our hypothesis that co-actors would modulate movement parameters in a communicative manner when they could see each other, the analysis of normalized AUCmean showed a larger area under the curve in the ‘visible’ condition, t(15) = −3.82, p < 0.01, Cohen’s d = −0.96. The difference in variability of curvature (normalized AUCvariability), t(15) = −1.4, p > 0.1, Cohen’s d = −0.35, was not significant.
